  The objective of the snack distributing robot project is to develop an autonomous system that enhances dining experiences by efficiently distributing snacks. This robot is designed to follow a designated black line on a dining table, ensuring precise navigation. It is equipped with an LCD to display the weight of the snack bowl, providing real-time information to users. An ultrasonic sensor is incorporated to detect obstacles and halt the robot for snack distribution, ensuring safety and accuracy. Additionally, a photoelectric sensor is used to dim the LCD backlight, optimizing power consumption and adapting to ambient light conditions. This project aims to integrate multiple sensors and control mechanisms to create a reliable, user-friendly, and energy-efficient snack distribution solution.

</div>

### Assumptions:
- The robot will be operating on a stable, flat surface such as a dining table, without significant inclines or irregularities
- The black line that the robot follows is consistently visible and free of obstructions or damage that could interfere with its sensors
- There is sufficient ambient lighting for the photoelectric sensor to function effectively and dim the LCD backlight as needed
- The path for the robot is clearly defined with a continuous black line, ensuring it can navigate without interruptions or the need for recalibration
- The weight of the snack bowl is within the capacity that the robot's weighing mechanism can accurately measure and display
- The dining area is generally free of unexpected obstacles, and the ultrasonic sensor can detect and respond to obstacles effectively
- The robot has a reliable power source, whether battery-operated or plugged in, to ensure continuous operation during its task
- Users understand and follow the operational guidelines for the robot, ensuring it is placed correctly on the dining table and the path is clear
- All sensors (line-following, ultrasonic, and photoelectric) are calibrated correctly and provide accurate data for the robot's operations
- Safety protocols are in place to handle any malfunction or unexpected behavior of the robot, ensuring user and property safety

### Constraints:
- The robot's operational time is limited by its battery life, requiring periodic recharging or battery replacement
- The robot is designed to operate on flat surfaces only and may not function correctly on uneven or textured surfaces
-  The effectiveness of the line-following capability is constrained by the visibility and integrity of the black line on the dining table
- The robot's weighing mechanism has a maximum weight limit for the snack bowl, beyond which it cannot provide accurate measurements
- The ultrasonic sensor has a limited detection range, affecting the robot's ability to detect obstacles that are too far or too close
- The photoelectric sensor's performance is influenced by the ambient lighting conditions, which can affect the LCD backlight dimming feature
- The microcontroller's processing power limits the complexity and speed of the robot's real-time decision-making and sensor data processing
- The robot is designed to follow a simple, continuous path and may not handle complex intersections or multiple branching paths effectively
- Regular maintenance is required to ensure the sensors and mechanical parts of the robot remain in optimal working condition
- The budget for building and maintaining the robot is constrained, impacting the choice of components and overall design
-  Users need to be familiar with the robot's operation, requiring instructions and possibly a learning curve for effective use
-  The robot's performance may be affected by environmental factors such as dust, moisture, and temperature variations, necessitating protective measures
